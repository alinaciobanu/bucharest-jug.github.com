    <h1>OSGi In One Day <br/>
        <small>Introduction and Hands-on Workshop on OSGi, the de-facto modularity solution for Java</small>
    </h1>

    <h3>What</h3>

    <p>
        We invite you to a 1-day mini-conference to learn about OSGi (<a href="http://www.osgi.org">www.osgi.org</a>),
        the
        de-facto modularity solution
        for Java. You learn the reasoning behind OSGi from two recognized experts in the field. You get to see in action
        a set of tools and existing components of the ecosystem (bndtools, Amdatu, Apache ACE) to make your life a lot
        easier when developing and deploying OSGi applications.
        You also have the chance to develop an application hands-on on your own laptop and thus experience firsthand a
        framework and toolchain that may help you in your next project.
    </p>
