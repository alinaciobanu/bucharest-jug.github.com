    <p>Interpreters are what make programming languages tick. They give life and meaning to otherwise sterile data. The CPU, a most important component of a computer, is an interpreter. Interpreters, though, are usually associated with scripting or dynamic languages, albeit this taxonomy is rather flawed.
      In this talk we will be showing how to write an interpreter for a toy programming language. The language will exhibit traits found in many mainstream programming languages, such as expression-based computations, variables, mutation, functions and closures.</p>
    <p>Learning what interpreters are and how they work is beneficial for at least two reasons. First, they offer a very convenient tool for deeply understanding fundamental concepts found in most programming languages, such as mutability, closures or recursion. Secondly, there are many circumstances where we, as programmers, have to use (or even write) domain-specific languages (DSLs). Possessing knowledge on how such a DSL might be implemented will never hurt, only help.</p>
    <p>We will use Scala as a host language, but we'll try to keep the numbers of Scala specific features low, so that a Java port would be easier to write.</p>
